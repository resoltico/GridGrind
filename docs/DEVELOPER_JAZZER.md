# Jazzer Developer Reference

**Purpose**: Authoritative architecture and policy reference for the GridGrind Jazzer layer.
**Companion references**:
- [DEVELOPER_JAZZER_OPERATIONS.md](./DEVELOPER_JAZZER_OPERATIONS.md) for command usage, run
  lifecycle, replay, promotion, and cleanup.
- [DEVELOPER_JAZZER_COVERAGE.md](./DEVELOPER_JAZZER_COVERAGE.md) for the harness matrix, promoted
  seed inventory, and current fuzzing gaps.
- [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for the main GridGrind build, module architecture, and root
  quality gates.

## Status

This document is the canonical source of truth for Jazzer in GridGrind.

As of `2026-03-27`, the Jazzer layer is implemented and working end to end.

Implemented now:
- standalone nested Gradle build at `jazzer/`
- local-only wrapper-script entrypoints under `jazzer/bin/`
- deterministic nested-build support tests under `jazzer/src/test/java/`
- four active fuzz harnesses plus a regression-mode replay run
- local full-gate orchestration through root `./check.sh`, which runs root verification and
  nested Jazzer `check` sequentially
- per-target run history, latest-summary artifacts, and per-harness telemetry
- replay and promotion tooling
- committed custom seed floor made of promoted regression inputs and readable example requests
- style-aware `.xlsx` round-trip verification for formatting depth, hyperlink/comment metadata,
  named-range persistence, named-range normalization, and the explicit `reads` pipeline
- local-only corpora, logs, finding artifacts, and cleanup commands

Deliberately not implemented:
- any root-build dependency on Jazzer
- any GitHub CI wiring for Jazzer
- any committed local corpus files
- any committed libFuzzer dictionary files
- any `.xls`, `.xlsm`, macro, encryption, or signing fuzzing

If the implementation and these docs diverge, fix one or the other immediately.

## Core Decisions

GridGrind uses Jazzer as a separate, local-only fuzzing layer.

The non-negotiable decisions are:
- `jazzer/` is a nested build, not a root subproject.
- Root `./gradlew check`, root coverage, and GitHub CI stay independent of Jazzer.
- Root `./check.sh` is the supported local orchestrator for sequential root-plus-nested
  verification.
- Root project-file formatting excludes local-only instruction and scratch areas,
  so local workspace state cannot break the canonical quality gates.
- The root Gradle wrapper is reused; there is no second wrapper.
- Wrapper scripts are the supported operator surface.
- Generated state stays under `jazzer/.local/`.
- Only intentionally promoted regression inputs belong in versioned source.
- Workbook scope remains `.xlsx` only.

The deterministic JUnit suite remains the primary correctness contract. Jazzer extends local
exploration and bug discovery; it does not replace standard testing.

---

## Custom Seed Strategy

GridGrind now keeps a small committed custom seed floor for every replayable Jazzer harness.

Seed policy:
- the committed seed floor must stay intentionally curated and small
- every committed seed must represent a meaningfully different semantic shape, not just a new hash
- the local generated corpus remains the large exploratory pool and stays uncommitted
- a promoted seed is not automatically a deterministic ordinary test; promote first, then decide
  whether it also deserves a main-suite regression test

Target-specific strategy:
- `protocol-request` favors human-readable `.json` seeds promoted from public example requests
- readable request seeds should follow the current public example contract exactly, including the
  current `reads` shape
- `protocol-workflow`, `engine-command-sequence`, and `xlsx-roundtrip` favor replay-verified
  binary seeds promoted from local corpus entries
- engine command seeds may be reused for `.xlsx` round-trip seeds when replay confirms they persist
  cleanly in the round-trip harness

The operator goal is not to maximize seed count. The goal is to preserve a stable minimum floor of:
- representative success cases
- representative expected-invalid cases
- representative feature-family coverage

Current floor:
- `protocol-request`: 12 committed seeds
- `protocol-workflow`: 10 committed seeds
- `engine-command-sequence`: 7 committed seeds
- `xlsx-roundtrip`: 9 committed seeds
- total committed seed floor: 38 inputs

---

## Dictionary Promotion Policy

GridGrind does not currently ship any committed libFuzzer dictionary files.

Recommended-dictionary output from a single fuzz run is advisory only. It is never promoted
automatically.

Promotion gate:
- the recommendation must repeat across multiple long runs of the same harness
- the candidate entries must be human-recognizable and harness-relevant
- the candidate dictionary must stay small and harness-specific
- the candidate dictionary must produce a measurable benefit in coverage or execution efficiency
  when compared with the same harness run without the dictionary

Disqualifiers:
- entries that appear to be one-run noise or corpus-specific overfitting
- very large opaque dictionaries assembled directly from one session's recommendation block
- dictionaries shared across unrelated harnesses
- dictionaries that improve only corpus size growth without improving coverage, feature count, or
  useful exploration speed

Promotion standard:
- require repeated appearance across at least three independent long runs of the same harness
- require a curated dictionary file containing only the smallest useful subset of entries
- require an A/B comparison for that harness using comparable duration and settings
- require documentation updates describing why the dictionary exists and what evidence justified it

If GridGrind ever adopts committed dictionaries, they must:
- be stored as harness-specific files under a dedicated `jazzer/` subdirectory
- remain local-only tooling for the nested Jazzer build
- never become an implicit dependency of the root build or CI

Until those criteria are met, the correct action for recommended-dictionary output is:
- keep the log
- continue collecting evidence
- do not commit a dictionary

---

## Scope Lock

In scope:
- `.xlsx` only
- protocol JSON parsing and validation
- ordered `DefaultGridGrindRequestExecutor` workflows
- direct workbook-command execution
- `.xlsx` save and reopen invariants

Out of scope:
- `.xls`
- `.xlsm`
- macros or VBA
- encryption and signing
- non-Excel formats

Tree rules:
- `jazzer/` is the only top-level home for Jazzer code and Jazzer-local state.
- `jazzer/src/main/java` contains shared support, telemetry, replay, report, and promotion code.
- `jazzer/src/test/java` contains deterministic tests for the Jazzer support and reporting layer.
- `jazzer/src/fuzz/java` contains only fuzz harness classes.
- `jazzer/src/fuzz/resources` contains only committed regression inputs and promotion metadata.
- `jazzer/.local/` is the only approved location for generated local fuzz state.

---

## Build Model

`jazzer/settings.gradle.kts` uses `includeBuild("..")`, so the nested build consumes the live
local `engine` and `protocol` modules without publishing snapshots.

`jazzer/build.gradle.kts` currently provides:
- standard `main` source set for shared support and local operator tooling
- standard `test` source set for deterministic support tests
- custom `fuzz` source set for Jazzer harness classes and committed regression inputs
- explicit JUnit 6, Jazzer 0.30.0, Jackson 3.0.3, Apache POI 5.5.1, and local module dependencies
- `JavaExec` tasks for local operator commands and per-harness Jazzer execution
- one explicit JUnit Platform launcher entrypoint for running Jazzer harnesses outside Gradle's
  `Test` result pipeline
- one aggregate `jazzerRegression` lifecycle task over the four per-harness regression tasks
- local cleanup tasks
- nested-build `check` coverage for deterministic Jazzer support tests plus regression replay only

Important boundary:
- the root build must not include `jazzer/`
- the nested build may depend on root modules through the composite build
- the nested build may evolve independently without affecting root CI

Nested-build verification model:
- `./gradlew --project-dir jazzer test` runs deterministic support tests only
- `./gradlew --project-dir jazzer jazzerRegression` replays the committed seed floor through four
  isolated per-harness regression tasks
- `./gradlew --project-dir jazzer check` runs `test` plus `jazzerRegression`
- root `./check.sh` runs root-project verification first, then nested Jazzer `check`, then
  release-packaging smoke verification
- active fuzz tasks remain explicit opt-in local commands and are never dependencies of nested-build
  `check`

Execution discipline:
- do not run root Gradle builds and nested Jazzer Gradle builds in parallel
- run root verification and Jazzer verification sequentially
- shared workspace outputs and caches can otherwise produce stale classpath or runtime state

## Run Targets

| Target | Gradle Task | Mode | Working Directory |
|:-------|:------------|:-----|:------------------|
| `regression` | `jazzerRegression` | regression replay | `jazzer/.local/runs/regression/` |
| `protocol-request` | `fuzzProtocolRequest` | active fuzzing | `jazzer/.local/runs/protocol-request/` |
| `protocol-workflow` | `fuzzProtocolWorkflow` | active fuzzing | `jazzer/.local/runs/protocol-workflow/` |
| `engine-command-sequence` | `fuzzEngineCommandSequence` | active fuzzing | `jazzer/.local/runs/engine-command-sequence/` |
| `xlsx-roundtrip` | `fuzzXlsxRoundTrip` | active fuzzing | `jazzer/.local/runs/xlsx-roundtrip/` |

Operator rule:
- the scripts under `jazzer/bin/` are the supported entrypoints
- raw `./gradlew --project-dir jazzer ...` remains available for debugging, but bypasses the
  script contract

`jazzer/bin/fuzz-all` is intentionally a shell sequencer over the four per-harness scripts so
each harness still gets its own lock, run history, summary, and telemetry artifacts.

`jazzer/bin/regression` follows the same isolation principle inside the nested build:
- one public command
- four isolated per-harness regression launcher tasks
- one aggregate `regression` summary under `jazzer/.local/runs/regression/`

This design is intentional. The regression seed floor is replayed one harness at a time so the
Jazzer build never depends on Gradle's `Test` binary-results store for fuzz-harness execution.
Deterministic support tests still run through the standard Gradle `test` task.

---

## Storage Contract

Committed and reviewable:
- harness classes under `jazzer/src/fuzz/java/`
- shared support and operator tooling under `jazzer/src/main/java/`
- promoted custom seeds under `jazzer/src/fuzz/resources/.../*Inputs/...`
- promotion metadata under `jazzer/src/fuzz/resources/dev/erst/gridgrind/jazzer/promoted-metadata/`
- documentation under `docs/` and `jazzer/README.md`

Local-only, never committed:
- `jazzer/.local/run-lock/`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/.cifuzz-corpus/`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/latest.log`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/latest-summary.json`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/latest-summary.txt`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/telemetry/*.json`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/findings/*`
- `jazzer/.local/runs/*/history/*`

Cleanup contract:
- `jazzer/bin/clean-local-corpus` removes generated corpus trees only
- `jazzer/bin/clean-local-findings` removes non-corpus local run state, including logs, summaries,
  telemetry, and replayed finding artifacts

---

## Reporting and Replay Model

Every supported fuzz run now leaves behind:
- a per-run `history/<timestamp>/run.log`
- a per-run `history/<timestamp>/summary.json`
- a per-run `history/<timestamp>/summary.txt`
- `latest-summary.json` and `latest-summary.txt` in the run directory
- per-harness telemetry snapshots under `telemetry/`

The operator tooling adds:
- `status` for a concise latest-summary table across targets
- `report` for detailed latest-summary output
- `list-corpus` for corpus state plus committed promoted inputs
- `list-findings` for replayed local finding artifacts
- `replay` for re-running one local input against one harness
- `promote` for copying one input into committed regression resources and writing metadata

Finding flow:
1. active fuzzing writes raw local finding artifacts such as `crash-*`
2. summary generation replays each raw artifact and writes human-readable finding artifacts
3. `replay` lets an operator inspect one input explicitly
4. `promote` copies a selected input into committed regression resources
5. `regression` replays the committed inputs on every local regression run
6. confirmed product bugs should still graduate into deterministic tests in the main suite

Summary semantics:
- `status` and `report` count only active findings as findings
- expected-invalid artifacts are surfaced separately when an old raw crash file now replays inside
  the documented invalid-input contract
- replay-clean artifacts are still surfaced separately so older local crash files that now replay
  cleanly are visible without being misreported as active failures

Telemetry semantics:
- sequence telemetry records operation kinds or command kinds per harness
- style telemetry records formatting-family usage such as font height, fill, font color,
  underline, strikeout, and border shapes
- protocol workflow telemetry also records source-type and persistence-type coverage
- response and error telemetry remain the primary triage signal for unexpected outcomes

---

## Compatibility Notes and Caveats

Jazzer/JUnit:
- Jazzer 0.30.0 publishes JUnit integration in "JUnit 5" terminology
- the nested build pins JUnit 6 explicitly and works with Gradle 9.4.1 in practice

Structured replay:
- replay for the structured harnesses uses Jazzer's internal
  `com.code_intelligence.jazzer.driver.FuzzedDataProviderImpl.withJavaData(byte[])`
  so replay semantics match the live harness data-provider semantics
- Jazzer 0.30.0's published jars omit `com.code_intelligence.jazzer.utils.UnsafeProvider`, even
  though `FuzzedDataProviderImpl` depends on it
- the nested build therefore vendors a minimal compatible copy of that single helper under
  `jazzer/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/utils/UnsafeProvider.java`
- this vendored helper exists only to make structured replay work in the isolated local Jazzer
  layer

Expected warnings:
- active fuzzing and structured replay still emit `sun.misc.Unsafe` deprecation warnings on
  Java 26
- these warnings are expected for Jazzer 0.30.0 and do not indicate a GridGrind defect

Configuration cache:
- active fuzz tasks participate in Gradle configuration caching
- local JavaExec operator tasks intentionally run with `--no-configuration-cache` via the wrapper
  script because they are local-only utilities and do not benefit enough from cache participation
  to justify the extra Gradle noise
